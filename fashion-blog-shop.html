      <h1>Concept</h1>
      <p>Before I do a photoshoot I make sure that I have a sharp conceptual framework in my mind to work from. Oftentimes, I will make lists of ideas in the notes section of my iphone and post inspiring images on private board on Pinterest as ways of brainstorming. If I have the opportunity, I make sure to speak with the person I am photographing about my goals and their boundaries, so that during the real shoot my process easily flows. Engaging in a dialogue is essential towards being able to create the artistic outcomes I like.</p>

      <h2>Capturing Candid Moments</h2>
      <h5>Don't Let Pretty Picture Opportunities Pass You By</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>I have discovered that sometimes the most interesting moments during my fashion photoshoots arise when the model is moving in a natural way that I capture spontaneously. To get into this space of artistic freedom and flow, you have to let go of feeling the need for every image to be perfect. I suggest viewing the photoshoot as an opportunity to see life in a new way, and savor still images that remind you of fleeting moments. I believe this mindset translates into an image that carries a magical energy that breathes life into a still photo. </p>

      <h2>Color</h2>
      <h5>Balancing Color for Fashion Shots</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>As a photographer, I have discovered it is crucial to pay attention to the color of my background and environment as much as the clothes on display. Additionally I am always remined to consider the model's skin color, eye color, and hair. If you want to create a really stunning image, think about how the colors you are photographing look before you get behind the camera. This way, when you actually begin to take some shots, your process will unfold much more naturally.</p>
